# flappybird
Flappy bird game made with C++ 

The program uses libraries given by the Professor to function.This is simply the C++ code me and my classmate used.
The code showcases collision, draw and updating images, different game states, a scoreboard and a gameobject class that implements a level of polymorphism and inheritance.
